        <p>A gnome-screensaver theme to replay go games from sgf files.  
        Uses both local files as well as games acquired automatically 
        from online sources.  Includes an sgf thumbnailer for gnome.
        Online sources can be customized via xml - 
        currently Gogames Screensaver supports games from eidogo.com, 
        gokifu.com and the Go Teaching Ladder.  If you have ideas for 
        other online sgf databases which should be supported, drop me a 
        line!  (I'm looking into kgs archives support, but the 
        organization of the files on kgs is obnoxious - suggestions on 
        this front are very welcome).</p>

        <p>Gogames Screensaver has only been tested under Ubuntu 10.10 
        with Python 2.6.  With some tweaking it can run in Windows 7, 
        but I haven't yet gotten around to making an installer.  If you 
        get this running on another system, contact me, and tell me how 
        you did it so that I can post about it here!</p>
    
        <h2>Dependencies</h2>
            <p>python 2.6<br />
            modules:<br />
                cairo<br />
                gio<br />
                glib<br />
                gtk<br />
                pango<br />
                rsvg<br />
                simpleparse</p>

        <h2>Install</h2>
        <p>Simply download and install the 
        <a href="https://github.com/downloads/JulianAndrews/Go-Games-Screensaver/gogames-screensaver_0.18_all.deb">.deb</a> 
        package!  The .deb includes more than a thousand games collected 
        by Andries E. Brouwer - you can find them
        <a href="http://homepages.cwi.nl/~aeb/go/games/index.html">here.</a></p>
        <p>Alternatively, ensure all needed python modules are 
        installed.  For Ubuntu 10.10,
        <pre>$ sudo apt-get install python-simpleparse python-cairo python-rsvg</pre>
        should be sufficient.  Then download the package, extract it and run
        <pre>$ sudo python setup.py install</pre> 
        in the source package folder.  You will need to get your own sgf 
        files and put them in the /usr/share/gogames-screensaver/sgf 
        folder, or configure the screensaver to look in another folder 
        with 
        <pre>$ gogames-screenaver -c</pre> 
        as the source package doesn't include the sgfs</p>
        <p>Currently, the setup.py method doesn't seem to be working.  
        The files all install to the correct locations and the program 
        and thumbnailers run, but gnome doesn't recognize the 
        screensaver.  If you have any ideas how to fix this, let me 
        know!</p>

            A screensaver to replay games of go from both local and 
            internet sources
        </div>
        <p>A gnome-screensaver theme to replay go games from sgf files.  
        Can use both local files as well as games acquired automatically 
        from online sources.  Online sources can be customized via xml - 
        currently Gogames Screensaver supports games from eidogo.com, 
        gokifu.com and the Go Teaching Ladder.  If you have ideas for 
        other online sgf databases which should be supported, drop me a 
        line!  (I'm looking into kgs archives support, but the 
        organization of the files on kgs is obnoxious).</p>
        <p>Gogames Screensaver has only been tested under Ubuntu 10.10 
        with Python 2.6.  With some tweaking it can run in Windows 7, 
        but I haven't yet gotten around to making an installer.</p>
    
        <h2>Dependencies</h2>
            <p>python 2.6<br />
            modules:<br />
                cairo<br />
                gio<br />
                glib<br />
                gtk<br />
                pango<br />
                rsvg<br />
                simpleparse</p>

        <h2>Install</h2>
        <p>Simply download and install the 
        <a href="https://github.com/downloads/JulianAndrews/Go-Games-Screensaver/gogames-screensaver_0.16_all.deb">.deb</a> 
        package!  The .deb includes more than a thousand games downloaded from <p>All games are from <a href="http://homepages.cwi.nl/~aeb/go/games/index.html">here.</a></p>
        <p>Alternatively, ensure all needed python modules are 
        installed.  For Ubuntu 10.10
        <pre>$ sudo apt-get install python-simpleparse python-cairo python-rsvg</pre>
        should be sufficient.  Then download the package and extract it 
        and run
        <pre>$ sudo python setup.py install</pre> 
        in the source package folder.  You will need to get your own sgf 
        files and put them in the /usr/share/gogames-screensaver/sgf 
        folder, or configure the screensaver to look in another folder 
        with <pre>$ gogames-screenaver -c</pre></p>
